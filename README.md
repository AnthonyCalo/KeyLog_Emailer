# KeyLog_Emailer

<h1>Use</h1>
<p>Keylogger that sends an email everytime the victim machine types 50 or more key strokes. 50 is an arbitrary variable number and can be changed without adverse effects</p>
This only works with gmail. For it to function correctly there is a gmail setting that needs to be changed.The setting is allow less secure apps.
</br>
</br>

If you use the python code you can enter your email/ password before hand in the variable instead of being prompted. 
I put up a .exe version of the program as well.

Program sends an email of keystrokes everytime the user types 50 characters.
